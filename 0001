To enhance the reliability of the program application process, we are shifting from apply.githubcampus.expert to GitHub Global Campus. As 
part of this transition, students who apply through the 
former website will now be redirected to Global Campus, where
they can submit their application. This change ensures a smoother experience and improved accessibility for all applicants.
